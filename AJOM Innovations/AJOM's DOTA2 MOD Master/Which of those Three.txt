(x64)
-this is the application that should be used by 64-bit architecture computers
-this is not compatible on 32-bit architectures
-has the best compatibility for 64-bit users


(x86)
-this is the application that should be used by 32-bit architecture computers
-this can still be used by 64-bit architecture computers since they support (x86) compatibility... But dont expect that the performance of this application will be better, Thats why I recommend using x64 type of this application
-has the best compatibility for 32-bit users
-the only compability for windows XP users


(x86-ANSI)
-if both of those application preceed with "ERROR PARSING STRINGS" when opening your DOTA2 after injecting your item sets, Use this alternative application
-has the best compatibility for 32-bit users
-compatible for 64-bit users
-this is just an alternative type of application,  so if the x64 or x32 works perfectly, you dont need to use this type of application
-Commonly used on WINDOWS 10(x64 or x86) due to compatibility




Additional Helpful Informations:
-XP and below is considered as 32-bit Architecture
-ANSI is just optional
